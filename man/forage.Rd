\title{Obtain various outputs using a trained tree ensemble on new data}
\usage{
forage(object, newdata, what = "dissimilarity", method = "terminalNodes",
  context = "observations", classes = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class 'ranger', 'randomForest'}

\item{newdata}{A dataframe}

\item{what}{(string) Type of output. Following are implemented:
terminalNodesMatrix, dissimilarity, proximity, outlyingness, depth. Default
is 'dissimilarity'}

\item{method}{(string) Method to obtain the output. Following are
implemented: terminalNodes. Default is 'terminalNodes'}

\item{context}{(string) Specify whether output should be computed for
'observations' or 'trees'. Default is 'observations'}

\item{classes}{(factor) Required when 'what' is 'outlyingness'}

\item{...}{Currently not in use.}
}
\value{
The following are returned depending on 'what':

  \itemize{

  \item \strong{terminalNodesMatrix}: A matrix with dimension number of
  observations times the number of trees. An entry is ID of the terminal
  node.

  \item \strong{dissimilarity}: A 'dist' object with size of number of
  observations.

  \item \strong{proximity}: A 'simil/dist' object(from 'proxy' package) with
  size of number of observations.

  \item \strong{outlyingness}: A vector of measure of outlyingness of each
  observation from its class.

  \item \strong{depth}: A matrix with dimension number of observations times
  the number of trees. An entry is depth of tgher

\description{
Obtain terminalNodesMatrix, dissimilarity, proximity,
  outlyingness, depth on new data using a tree ensemble. Currently, ensembles
  from 'ranger' and 'randomForest' packages are supported. See details for
  the explanation about various outputs.
}
\details{
\itemize{

  \item For 'terminalNodes' method, proximity between two observations is
  defined as the propotion of trees in which both observations end up in the
  same terminal node. Similarly, proximity between two trees is defined as
  the rand index of the terminalnode vectors of the trees for all
  observations.

  \item Dissimilarity is defined as sqrt of (1 - proximity) in case of
  observations and (1 - proximity) in the case of trees.

  \item When a vector of classes is given, outlyingness of a observation from
  its class is defined as the reciprocal sum of squared proximities of the
  observations of the class.
